# RemoteControlledSpeakerArduino
Remote controlled speaker and motion activated LCD in Arduino
# Materials needed
Preferably buy the ELEGOO MEGA 2560 Starter Kit Project (NOT SPONSORED)<br />
Otherwise:
- Arduino MEGA 2560 or any other type of Arduino(but might need to adjust all pins from code)
- Breadboard
- Passive Buzzer ELEGOO
- LCD1602 Module(with pin header)
- HC-SR501 PIR Motion Sensor Module
- IR Receiver ELEGOO Module
- Remote Control ELEGOO
- Potentiometer 10K Ohms ELEGOO
- any color LED
- 2 220 Ohms resistors
- 1 100 Ohms resistors
- Lots of Jumper Wires and Female-to-Male Dupont Wire or other connections for Breadboard to Arduino
# Software Libraries Needed
Need to install the IR remote library by shirriff, z3t0, ArminJo<br />
